# koskela_sourcecode
The original source code from Test Driven by Lasse Koskela as well as an updated version - https://www.manning.com/books/test-driven

# CPTR245_Lab2
this project is about coverage, quality-control, and continuous integration tools and how to utilize them to analyze a project.

# Status Before Services were Added
So i did not understand how to get services to analyze my project that weren't available in the integration services area of the repo settings.
I was able to connect Code Climate to my project, I looked into Codacy and Codecov and i didn't really understand how to connect those to my repo.
the project i decided to use for this lab was koskela_sourcecode, sourcecode with a bunch of different programs from the textbook.
So far the project has 0 tests that i'm aware of, as the project is just full of source code for the programs themselves, not their tests.

# Summary of new Tests to Improve Test Coverage

# Code Changes Based on Code Review Tool (quality improvements)
## Code Climate
Using Code Climate to analyze the koskela_sourcecode project, there were 9 suggested code quality improvements that were reccommended for me under the "Issues" section. Most of these refactoring suggestions had to do with something Code Climate called "Cognitive Complexity," which i'm assuming has to do with how complicated the code itself was. Their recommended Complexity Level was 5. Code Climate judged some code to have Complexity ranging from 7, all the way to 20. The higher the complexity level, the longer the estimated-fix-time was. Another type of quality control provided by Code Climate was code length. Any function past 25 lines of code was recommended for refactoring. Unfortunately, none of these quality control issues were simple enough that i felt like i could actually improve them.......
