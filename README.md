# koskela_sourcecode
The original source code from Test Driven by Lasse Koskela as well as an updated version - https://www.manning.com/books/test-driven

# CPTR245_Lab2
this project is about coverage, quality-control, and continuous integration tools and how to utilize them to analyze a project.

# Status Before Services were Added
So i did not understand how to get services to analyze my project that weren't available in the integration services area of the repo settings.
I was able to connect Code Climate to my project, I looked into Codacy and Codecov and i didn't really understand how to connect those to my repo.
the project i decided to use for this lab was koskela_sourcecode, sourcecode with a bunch of different programs from the textbook.
So far the project has 0 tests that i'm aware of, as the project is just full of source code for the programs themselves, not their tests.
