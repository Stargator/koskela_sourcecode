The original source code from Test Driven by Lasse Koskela is found on the [branch named "original"](https://github.com/Stargator/koskela_sourcecode/tree/original).

I am also working on a version that will be updated with more recent versions of dependencies, it can be found on the [branch called "develop"](https://github.com/Stargator/koskela_sourcecode/tree/develop).
